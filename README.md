# onama-corpus

Using the 'ONAMA query', a number of exemplary narratives can be found which illustrate how the ontology works. These narratives essentially revolve around two thematic focuses, which are often present in medieval literature and visual art. These are, on the one hand, the Story of Jason and the Argonauts with the Quest for the Golden Fleece, anchored in the context of the Trojan War; and on the other hand, narratives about Fighting with or Taming wild Animals.

The data on the Argonaut saga are based on the pictorial realisations in Codex 2773 of the Austrian National Library, a German-language adaptation of Guido de Columnis Historia destructionis Troiae with opulent miniatures by Martinus Opifex (c. 1450), and on the textual realisations in two romances, the Liet von Troye by Herbort von Fritzlâr (c. 1190) and Der Trojanische Krieg by Konrad von Würzburg (c. 1280).

The thematic area Fighting with or Taming wild Animals offers exciting, multifaceted realisations that span across texts from MHDBDB and images from REALonline. In connection with this theme are a number of recorded narratives that go beyond medieval literature and are taken from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, concerning the dragon Smaug.
